# How-fast-is-the-energy-transition-progressing? 

## Project Overview
This project offers a detailed analysis of global energy consumption from the year 2000 through 2023. Our main goal is to identify the fundamental, long-term shifts across all eight major energy sources: Coal, Gas, Oil, Nuclear, Hydro, Wind, Solar, and Bioenergy. 
Specifically, the analysis aims to determine which sources still dominate the market, how quickly new technologies are growing, and what caused the major shifts seen in the last few years. Focus has also been placed on regional specificity to see what is at play across the different continents. 


## Project Objective
The primary objectives of this energy consumption analysis project (2000–2023) were to:
1.	Quantify and define the long-term dominance and consumption trends of traditional, non-renewable energy sources (Coal, Gas, Oil, and Nuclear) over the $23$-year period.
2.	Determine the growth rate and acceleration of modern renewable energy sources (Wind, Solar, and Bioenergy), establishing their current scale relative to the overall global energy mix.
3.	Analyse recent data (specifically the 2023 consumption figures) to identify any critical anomalies or inflexion points across all energy sources, and provide context for potential drivers of these sudden shifts.
4.	Use data visualisation to provide clear, comparative insights into the transition state of the global energy system, highlighting the tension between entrenched fossil fuel reliance and exponential renewable adoption.
5.	Highlight regional trends in the energy consumption. 


## Data Source
The analysis uses data compiled by the energy think tank Ember to track the energy transition, which was accessed via the Kaggle platform.
[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasur965/hgfgfdgdsa)

The raw dataset was structured as a single table containing key fields such as entity(Country/region in question), year, energy source, with energy consumption recorded in Terawatt-hours (TWh). 


## Tools 
The spreadsheet software EXCEL was used for data cleaning, while Power BI was used for visualisation and reporting. 


## Analytical Approach 
This comes after the data cleaning and standardization phase had been carried out using Excel and advanced functions done using power query. 
The core of the analysis was executed using a standardised dashboard template that allowed for comparative and time-series analysis across different dimensions of global energy consumption. This structure was designed to seamlessly pivot between macro trends and granular details, directly addressing the project's objectives.



### Comparative Energy Source Analysis

The first page of the analysis provided a detailed view of consumption by source, enabling clear comparisons and trend tracking.
The dashboard was filtered to focus on a single selected energy source at a time (e.g., Coal, Hydro, Bioenergy). This isolated view enabled the precise tracking of each source's performance over the 23 years.


### Regional-Level Analysis

The second page shifted the focus to macro-level consumption and comparative regional performance, serving as a powerful overview and cross-check:

A comprehensive Energy Consumption Trend chart visually plotted the time-series data for all eight energy sources simultaneously. This overlay was essential for identifying structural relationships, divergence points (e.g., when Solar's growth accelerates past Nuclear's). 



## Results and Insights


#### Short Term Insights

The results confirm that the global energy mix remains overwhelmingly dominated by two traditional fossil fuels, though their recent performance has been volatile.

1. Coal and Gas are the foundation of global energy. In 2023, they collectively accounted for 58.1% of the total energy mix (Coal: 35.9%, Gas: 22.2%). Coal remains the single largest source, with a total consumption of 10,431.70 TWh in 2023, and surprisingly, the demand for coal as an energy source continues to peak, and despite the transition plans, Coal consumption in 2023 was still 80.1% above its Year 2000 level, illustrating how much energy demand has outpaced decarbonization efforts over the past two decades.

2. Natural Gas usage has dramatically increased, climbing 137.5% over the 2000 level. As a fossil fuel, it's non-renewable, yet it plays a key role as a transition fuel due to its lower emissions footprint compared to coal and fuel oils. This benefit has spurred its massive adoption, notably in Africa, where it now serves as the primary source of electricity generation

3. The trend line for oil shows the most significant structural decline among non-renewables. In 2023, oil consumption was only 749.00 TWh, a substantial drop of 38.9% compared to its level in 2000. Although demand for oil as a source of electricity increased in 2010, it continued to decline in 2012. A similar pattern is also observed in 2020. 


4. Clean energy reached 39.4% of global consumption in 2023, with dedicated renewables making up over 30% of the total. Hydro was the biggest single contributor (14.4%, 4,178.55 TWh). Nuclear supplied 9.2% (2,673.41 TWh). The high-growth sources of Wind (7.9 %, 2,283.58 TWh) and Solar (5.5%, 1,610.25 TWh) provided a substantial and growing share, alongside Bioenergy (2.1%, 601.64 TWh) and other renewables (0.3%, 85.11 TWh).



#### Long Term Insights 

Global energy demand has nearly doubled over the last two decades, clearly illustrating the massive scale of industrialisation and the continuous need for energy to power groundbreaking technologies. Demand grew by a total of 92.8%, rising from 15,064.92 TWh in 2000 to 29,050.48 TWh in 2023. 

Despite this huge demand increase, the share of fossil fuels has declined structurally, moving from 64.6% of total global consumption in 2000 to 60.6% in 2023. This reduction confirms the impact of concerted global efforts toward adopting renewable energy sources. The consumption of most individual fossil fuels continued to increase in absolute volume over the period, with the sole exception of Oil, which has seen a steep, long-term decline. 

The growth of modern renewables, Solar and Wind, is the primary driver of this shift. Their combined share has surged from a negligible 0.2% in 2000 to a significant 13.4% of global consumption in 2023. This growth has accelerated dramatically in recent years.

The combined consumption increase for Solar and Wind was 1,044.63 TWh over the 15 years between 2000 and 2015. In stark contrast, the increase was 2,507.24 TWh in the short 8-year period between 2015 and 2023, nearly 2.4 times the growth of the previous 15 years. While both sources are growing exponentially, Wind energy currently holds a larger share, mainly due to its earlier market adoption.




The sector is making progress, but the required scale-up is immense. In 2023, Solar grew impressively by 23%, and Wind increased by approximately 10% from 2022 levels. This sustained, high-speed growth in both Solar and Wind must continue and accelerate for the global energy system to successfully pivot away from fossil fuels, as envisioned in Net Zero scenarios.

Progress in other key low-carbon sources is stalling and even reversing, posing a significant risk to decarbonization efforts: Consumption from Hydro actually declined by 2% in 2023, contributing to the overall energy contraction. This reversal is critical because global Hydro potential is heavily underutilised. Current estimates suggest that only 30% of the world's hydroelectricity potential is currently tapped, with Africa holding the least utilised potential (estimated at 6-11% utilisation). 
Scaling up this established, dispatchable renewable source, particularly in developing regions, is a vital, immediate opportunity to meet decarbonization targets.



#### Regional Imbalance in Energy Consumption

1. Asia accounted for 55.1% (15,237.65 TWh) of total global consumption in 2023. Total energy production in the region increased by a significant 4.9% in 2023 over 2022 levels, notably higher than the world's average increase of 2.2%. Much of this is driven by high demand in China and India.

The region's energy profile is heavily dependent on coal. Coal dominates, accounting for over 50% (8,585 TWh) of regional consumption. This is followed by Hydro (1,798.5 TWh) and Gas (1,629 TWh). Despite their growth, renewables (including Hydro, Wind, and Solar) made up just 19.7% of the continent's total energy supply in 2023, falling below the global average share.

2. Europe represents the world's second-largest consumer, but its trends show a clear move toward demand management and decarbonization. Europe held a 17.9% (4,951.58 TWh) share of global consumption in 2023. Notably, this represented a 2.0% decline from the previous year's value, indicating a deceleration in demand (although consumption remains 10.6% above 2000 levels).
Policy efforts have resulted in a higher mix of clean sources, with renewables contributing over a quarter (25.2%) of Europe's total energy consumption. The energy mix is more diversified than Asia's, and the gradual reduction in fossil fuel contribution is evident. Natural Gas is the top source (1,201 TWh). Nuclear (965 TWh) and Hydro (818 TWh) are close behind. Coal consumption trails with 713 TWh. Europe demonstrates a gradual reduction in fossil fuel contributions that contrasts sharply with the massive, exponential increase in high-growth renewables like Solar (291 TWh) and Wind (609 TWh).

3. North America's energy profile is defined by high per-capita consumption and a strategic policy-driven decline in coal usage. The region accounted for 17.7% (4,884.46 TWh) of global consumption in 2023.
 
Consumption saw a 1.3% drop from the previous year, though it remains 10.9% above the Year 2000 level.

The energy mix is led by Gas (1,893 TWh), followed by Nuclear (864 TWh). The sharp, policy-driven decline of Coal is evident, as it contributed 707 TWh, only slightly more than the combined output of Solar and Wind (708 TWh). This accelerated reduction is largely due to the massive decommissioning of coal plants in the U.S., the region's most influential country.

4. The region of South and Central America region stands out as the global leader in renewable integration, thanks largely to its natural hydropower resources. The region contributed 5.0% (1,378.36 TWh) to global consumption, marking a strong 4.2% increase from 2022 and a long-term growth of 73.7% since 2000.

South and Central America boast the highest share of clean energy in the analysis, with renewables accounting for a remarkable 66.3% of total consumption. Hydro energy is the foundation, contributing more than half the region's energy (745 TWh). This clean energy base is supplemented by Gas (241.25 TWh). Wind energy is a significant modern contributor (134 TWh or approx 10% of regional consumption), outpacing Oil (93 TWh) and Coal (53.72 TWh).

5. Africa's consumption figures reveal a critical energy deficit, highlighting a major development challenge despite its vast population. 

Accounting for a mere 3.2% (878.3 TWh) of global electricity consumption, Africa has the lowest energy per capita at 0.56 MWh. This contrasts sharply with Asia (3.17 MWh), Europe (6.7 MWh), and North America (7.9 MWh).

The region relies heavily on Gas (373.8 TWh) as its single most important source, with gas consumption steadily increasing. Coal (223.4 TWh) is the second-largest source, but its contribution is notably on the decline. Hydro (150 TWh) is a key contributor, while Solar (27 TWh) and Wind (27 TWh) show early but promising signs of growth

6. 
Oceania's energy story is one of a traditional, coal-based system increasingly disrupted by local renewable deployment. The continent consumed 331 TWh in 2023, representing a 0.5% increase from 2022 and a long-term growth of 25.8% since 2000.

Coal remains the largest contributor (130.41 TWh). However, the influence of modern renewables is immediate: Solar (47.59 TWh) is the second-largest source, followed closely by Gas (46.86 TWh). This dynamic highlights an accelerating energy transition where solar generation is already a primary energy source, challenging the dominance of fossil fuels.

## Recommendations
Based on the quantitative insights derived from this analysis, the following strategic recommendations are proposed to support a more resilient, equitable, and successful energy transition:

1. Prioritize Investment in Underutilized Hydro Capacity
Focus immediate, low-carbon capital investment on unlocking latent Hydro capacity, especially in Africa. Scaling up this established, dispatchable renewable source provides essential baseload stability that highly volatile Wind and Solar cannot yet offer, directly addressing the dual goals of decarbonization and energy access in developing regions.


2. Implement Differentiated Decarbonization Strategies for Asia and Europe
Asia (with 55.1% of global consumption and 50% of its energy from Coal) requires massive displacement strategies, whereas Europe is focused on managing a shrinking, more diversified demand.

For Asia, policy efforts must centre on high-volume renewable mandates to rapidly displace Coal (8,585 TWh consumption). For Europe and North America, policy efforts should shift towards grid modernisation and storage to manage the continued decline of flexible sources like Nuclear and Coal while maintaining grid reliability as intermittent Solar and Wind scale.



3. Leverage Gas as a Transitional Tool in Energy-Deficient Regions
Africa has the lowest energy per capita (0.56 MWh) and relies primarily on Gas, which is increasing, while Coal declines.
Recognise Natural Gas as a necessary, lower-emission bridge fuel for accelerating energy access in energy-poor regions like Africa, where it displaces higher-polluting Coal and Oil in the short term, ensuring economic development is not impeded while long-term investments in Solar and Wind capacity catch up.
